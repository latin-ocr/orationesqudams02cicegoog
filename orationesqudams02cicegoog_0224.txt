end others join in the nequest mnde for his pardon, he began to
be inclined to ant it. At this time, Quintus Tubero, son of Lu-

merly received into Africa, and being therefore desirous to obstruct
an favor intended to be bestowed up'on Ligarius, that he might
e ectually gratify his vindictive desires, brought forward an accu-

war in Africa· against Caesar with uncommon zeal 'and violence.

aversion to him, had renewed the African wer, was pleased by e
accusation, and, being greatly prejudiced against the defendant,
changed his former determination, and became resolved to sacrifice
him to the gmtification of his own revenge. Plutarch relntes, that
