tuly, From his hopes of impunity.
And the evidence, upon which these circumstances ara alleged,
are the words and actions of the deceased.
⁴ 'l'he conclusion of the whole is, Milo acted on seli-defence, and

Clodinswas lawsullylliilled. ,

Milo was not tried by the praetor, as was usual in criminal'cases,
butby a special commission and all extraordinary judge. By noca
forma he refers ιο the strong guard, which Pompey brought ιο the
trial, in order to prevent any violence.

had meson to apprehend no less trpuble. Cicero, bein sensible of
this, as well as the great authority and influence of lompey, en-
deavors through the whole of this. oration, to remove the effecta
which they might have upon the minds of the judges.

reflecte upon as an insult upon the liberty of the bench.

1. Quid ewimnobrisduobnsmtc: Cicero here excites thecompaasion 101 r ·
of the judges in his own and Milo’s favor, froma consideration of the
services they haddone the state, and the injuries they had received .
from the Clodians. Milo might justly claim the highest offiees, on
account of his merit; and accordin ly had been ormerly created
tribune, and now stood for the consulship.

12. T. Annii ιτῶιιοαιιι, etc: Milo was a tribune the year aster
Clodius filled that office, and, dnrin his tribuneship, he checked the
seditione of Clodius, and exerted himself to procare the recall of
Cicero from exile.

ll. dimidias Miloni a Clodio factas.- The great point which
Cicero wishes to prove, is, that Clodius waylaid Milo; but while he
demonstratas this, he frequently insinuates, that, if Milo had pre·

derived from the examples of former ages of the republic, and from
