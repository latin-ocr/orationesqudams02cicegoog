3. Terris...vigtlia.· The Romans divided the night 'into four wateh· 27
es. The third watch commenced about midnight, and terminated
“ about three o’elock in the morning.
ll. Es fatis Sibyllinis: When Tarquinius Superbus was king of
Rome acertain woman, called Amalthea from a foreign country, is
sara a} have come to unwanng ro seri sane oopus of sibyllina οι

she sirightvihe sameypriee for the remaining six. Resurredg again, ehi . l
went and burnt other three, and, coming back, still demanded the same
price for the three which remained. Tarquin, surprised at the strange
conductos the woman, consulted the Augure, and bought the books.
The woman, having delivered them, and received her price, desired
them to be caresully kept, then suddenl disap eared, aud was never
afterwards seen. The books were foun to be tEe oracles of the Sibyl
of Cumae, aud soon beg‘an to be religiously respected at Rome. They
were supposed to contain the fate of the Roman em ire, and were
kept in a stone obest under ground in the temple oi Jupiter Capi·
tobosa-Arwpieumque responsis: The Aruspices examined the vrc-
tims and their entrails, aller they were sacrificed, and from them,
and also from the fleme, smoke, and other circumstances attending,
the sacrifice, derived omens of futurity.
1. Tertium illum Corneliam: Among the Sibylline verses three 28
K’s were found, which, it was supposed, would be fatal to liberty.
They were applied by the Romans to the three Cornelii, Cornelius
Cinna, Oomehus Su la, and Cornelius Lentulus.

3. Cinnam: During the civil wara between Marius aud Sulla, L.
Cornelius Cinna, a man rash in counsel, but resolute in action, was ι

“ raised ιο the consulship, and had no sooner entered upon his office, i
l

l

than he began ιο entertain a design of overturning all the acts Sulla
hadpsssed. Being'soon aiter deposed, by the senate, srom the dig·
nrty of. consul, ou account of ,illegal conduct, he left the city, raised
an arm in ltal , recalled Marius, who had be'en banisbed, made
hirnse master oi Rome, murdered the friends of Sulla, who was con·
ducting the war in Asia against Mithridates, and whom he declared
“ banished from the city, and, for three successive years, usurped the
. consulship, and associated with himself whom he pleaeed as col· Α

leugues. At the expiration of these years, Sulla made a ace with
Mithridates, and came toward Rome3 and such were t e number
and importance of his victories, the splendor arrd riehes of his army,
and the greatness of his power, that when Cinna had raised troops
to opposo him, they revolted t'rom their general, and, when he men-
ace thern, slew im.—Srdlom.· The eumity between Marius and
Sulla first arose srorn a dispute concerning the glory of terminating
the Jugurthine war. The immediate cause of their hostile actions
against each other, was a law passed by P. Sulpicius, transferring
the command of the Asiatic expedition a inst Mithridates from
Sulla to Marius. The law was passed illegaly; Sulla, who was but
a short distance from Rome, immediately returned, and procured the
banishment of Marius aud the death of Sulpicius. ¹He then suceess-
full conducted the Asiatic war. In his absence, the Marian fection
«i garn took command of the cit ; Marius was recalled,

. e

girlliargalsiiiiiished in his turn, and bis iriensis were murdered. After
hispeace with Mithridates, however, Sulla returned to the 'city rn

defiauce of ιὴῆοῐᾱεῐο of the senate, and conquered his enemies.
