Pompey’s party had succeeded, victory and its consequences would 65
have been more bloody.

cemenc .

28. odinimrcmctaltdsortassc: It would bove been better to omit
the word stulto. Caesar might hawebbeen raised t'or his clemency‚
without hearing the republican oprmons odhrs antagonist degraded
by the appellatron offo y.

ed, suspected that Marcellus still harbored evil designs against him.

18. Omnia, cta: Cicero here advises Cesar to restore the repub- 67
lic, and correct the abuees of its constitution; and such was his ad·
dress, that the advice was not displcasing to the despot; but it was
improbable that an usurper so ambitione os power as was Cesar,
should obcerwe counsels so contrary to the des' ns sor the comple·
tion of which he had fought and slain above amifiion of men.

30. Illam....occcm....satis ιίἰιι...ιιίι“.· nster having complained of
the animosity of Marcellus, Cesar said, that he himself hod lived
long enough for either nature or glory. At this tirne he was in the

un -fourth year of his age.

36. Crebro dictra- Suetonius relates, that Cesar had in reality
‘ven some of his friends reason to believe, that he did not wish to
ve longer, and that he did not regnet the ill state of his health.

⁷. Vide, queso, nc tuo divina virtus, etc: Cicero here deserves 68
credit sor his address, and the freedom of his caution.

27. Νιιιιι, ctiam porc lauda, exspectat: The freedom os this remark
also is to be commended. Cesar was, without doubt, a man os great
nbilities; posterity will long admire his taleam hut, as Cicero tells
him, it ought to see something it can commend as well as admire.
Insatiable ambition and goodness are seldom companions.

28. Imperia, provincias, etc: Cesar had commanded an army in
Gaul Britain, Germany aud Africa. Spain, atter hisproetorship,
and deul aster his consulship, were the provinces assigned to him.
He first built a brid over the Rhine, over which he passed his army,
and conquered the ermans. He first commandeda flectin the At-
lantic ocean,b which he carried his army into Great Britain. He
con uered Ptolemy, kin ofE pt, a countr annuall overflowed
by eriver Nile. For the numhyer os his bat es, see ote, page 63,
line 20. Monuments and statues were erected to him atter hrs civ-

il ware, and honora were paid to him asto a god. Aswas usual
after victorico, hc had given many presente to his soldiers, and had
also entertained the ople with seasts, theatriccl exhibitione, &a

that dignitd⁷ which he nlwa s should hove possessed when addressin
Caesar, “notwithstanding ah these, your fame may be spread through
the world, but it will never be stabla, unless yon strengthen this city
b your counsels, and guard it by your laws.' Fortius passage, and
· lde succeeding remarks, Cicero deserves great credit.
