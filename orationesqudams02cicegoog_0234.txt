Tiiis elegant oration was delivered iii the ecana year of Rome, two
years ester the consulship of Cicero, and one year atter the defeat of
Catilineaud his accomplices. In early lise Cicero had been placed =
under the tuition of Aulus Lucidius Archias, a native of Antioch,
and a man patronized by menos the greatest eminence in Rome for

,his learning, genius, and politeness. Hir celebrity was so great,
that Lucullus invited himto reside iii his family, and gave him the. ¹
privilege of opening a school in it, to which many of the young Ro-
man nobility were sent to he educated. The prosperity of this popu·

, lar poet and instructor, however, was interrupted by the malignity
of aii obscure person, os the name of Gracchus, or by the subornation
of those who persuaded him to acti of enmity against Archias. Syl·
vanusand Carbo had passed a law, which enacted, that those should
bsesteemed Roman citizens, who were admitted ιο the freedom of

M. i' Piso and M: V. Messala, Gracchus accused Archias3 he 'said
that Archias lived iii the city as a citizen, while he was not entitled
tc the rights of citizenship. He denied that Archias was admitted
to the freedom of any of the confederated cities, that he had an rhode
inultaly, attha time the law was passed, and that lie had claimed the
privileges os a citizen bel'ore the praetor. Iii this oration, which was
delivered before the praetor, Cicero defends Archias, his friend and
former instructor: he refutes the alle atione of Gracchus, and proves·
that Archias was admitted to the reedom cf Heraclea and other
citrea, that he dwelt in Italy at ,the time of the passing of the law,
aud that hs claimed his iivile es before the pretor. The orator,
however, does not contine himseli to the defence of Archias, but, with
great heaut and elegance, demam upon the raises of poetry in
general, an upon the talenta aad meritos the deidndaut. According
to Dr. Middleton, Cicero “expected for his pains an immortality ot

things, instead of deriviug any addition of lory iiam Archias's com·

vrinngs.” At the time of delivering this oration, Cicero was in the
scrip-ruth yeiyr⁰ of his age.
