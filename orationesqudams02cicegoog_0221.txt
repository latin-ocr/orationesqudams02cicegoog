to n conqueror, in the height of all his power, should went to be

twenty-tire drys os congmtulstion were decreed to him for his suc·

· cesses in Geni, und we nro told by Dio, thetntier his civil wurs forty
dsys more were for like purposes decreed to him. But the doy here

on rt he hed extended merny end forgiveness, which ore personsl
virtues, end cannot, like the gloriosos wer, be shsred by others.

42. Victores buterum civilium: The victories of Sulla, Marius, Oc·
tevins ond Cinna, were succeeded by sanguinat yengesnce.

wos dewrous of peace, Cicero sdyised it, nnd Pompey rejected it.

demonstrsted thot he wns neither n grent politicion nor sn oble gen-

26. Prudens ct scinu....od interitum....ooluntcriumr Cicero in this ·
sentence ossigns for the whole meson of his joining Pompey what
was only one of his inducements. He really thoughtthat Cesar
was an enemy to his countr , ond thst the sefet o the republic
would be coexistent with ompey's success. e therefore, from

liticsl principle, united himself to the Pompeinn party. But he

ere tells Closer, thot he sided with Pompey from private, not public
motives bound by ties of gratitude for the personui fsvors he hod
received from him, snd that, cool, end conscious of his danger, he
plunged, ss it were, into voluntnry destruction. This spology might

ove been successfu13 but itis tobe regretted, thet tnlents sc great
ss those os Cicero confessedly were, should be employed in n service
so dishonoroble ns that of flattery ond dissimulation.

30. Cum capitis mci periculo: The following comment hus been
mede upon these words. Cicero was not present at the bnttle cf

' Phnrsclrs, nor wos Ceto, who stuid behind also in the comp nt
Dyrrachium, which he commended with fifteen cohorts, when Lnbi·
enus brought them the news of Pompey’s defent3 upon which cato

his refusal ot' it, ns Plutarch tells ns, young Pompey wns so enraged,
that he drew his sword. und would have killed him upon the spot, it'
Ceto hod not prevented it. Though this fnct is not mentioned by
Cicero, yet it is probable he refers to it iu this passage. -
