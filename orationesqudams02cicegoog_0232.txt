urna unornane. ⁴ 227

31. Legatornm pedibas: Phidippus bad boen in the 'service of Dei· 79 1

otarns's deputes, and perhaps in no more honorable a capacity than

that of a footntan.
9. Sed tud sapientie fit oewhnmnm: Sufficiant has already been 80

. said concerning Cicero’s flattery of Coesar.

ll. Narro cnimfcrd cst, cta: This observation is just, and Cicero
deservcs credit for suggesting it to' Cesar. 'Whena man is both
jud e and party in an accusation, there is great probability, that he
wihibe more favorabls to himself than to the aceused.

34. Qui pro maltis sape dixisti: In a note to a former oration (page
77, line 4), we have already observed, that Caesar, in the early part of
his life, appliedhimself to the business of the bar. Ι

38. De accusatorum sper That the student may be able to jndge
mors impartiall of the character of Deiotarus and his accusers, we
will note an o ervatiou of a judicious ¹commentator. a As to the '
facniaid down in this oration, we can say very little 3 but, by· what
we understand from our author himself an other parts of hrs wrrtrngs,
the charges ara not so destitute of probability and proof, as he would
tafftffhltndllltttlft {¹¹AE tltttndttttt'tttilt:
represented3 for, hy all other accounts, he appears to ave been a
monster of blood and crnelty3 since he put ιο death all his own
children, and afterwards Castor¹s own father, which may well ac-
count for Castor's appearing in the prosecution.’'

19. Si....cacasotione motis nnis asset: It is related that Caesar told 8]
Deiotarus, “ Yon are a very old man ; Pompey is not ιο expect, that
you are to take the field 3 therefore I beg you will not go in person,
though, if you please, yon may send your troops; nay, your son at
their head; '’ and that Deiotarus was so inveterate an enemy to Cre·
ffighag he would not urge even old age as an excuse for not taking

e el .

211. Errare commoni lapsas est.- Cicero here artfully apologizet for
Deiotarus without offending Caesar, by paying the tribute of flattery,
which in a few lines follows, and by ap aring ιο believe, the plausi-
ble excuses Caesar had formed to justify 's usurpations. '

2. In quem clim Dii οιγοο tornines, etc: Env and emulation oease 82
with the life of the person envied and rivalte . An ambitions inan,
therefore, will hear without being offended the praises bestowed upon

“ a deceased enemy, which, had the enemy been living, would have

induced him to inflict upon the panegyrim the dictatas of the severest
vengeanoe. The encomiums Cicero ere prononnoes upon Pompey

were, without doubt, rather pleasing than offensive to Caesar ; the

, more Pompey was extolled, the more merit the conqueror of Pom-

γογ attributed to himself. Cicero, therefore, who well knew the ef·
ect of compliments‚ deserves here more credit for his knowledge of
mankind, than for the freedom of his praiscs of Pompey.

23. Alexandrinam tellam: After the battle of Pharsalia, Ceasar irn-

mediately set sail for E ypt, to which country Pompey had fied astet
his defeat. Upon his fanding, the first news he received informed
him of Pom y's miserable end. He wept, when he heard the ac·
count, ands ortly afler ordered a magnificent tornb ιο be built ιο
his memorg. At this time there were two pretenders to the crown

dnined accepting thia proposui, end sent nn army of twenty thou·
