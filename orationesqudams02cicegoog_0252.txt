the senate was under the control of Cicero, implied, that the senate
decreed nothing against Milo 3 which contradiction to the assertions
of the other enemres of Milo, Cicero here notices.

relation not only to a kinswoman, but also 10 a vestal virgin, or any
female immediatel employed iu performing the rites and ceramo·

tion to Cresar’s wife, while she was engaged ru celebratrng the mys·

was thought too eneral, and to include several distinct articles
some 01Ι which migirt be approved, and others rejected, 11 was usual
to require that it might be divided. This was the case with the
first decrea relative to the death of Clodius; it contained three dis·

the court, aud the attack upon Lepidus's house, were acts hostiis to

there should be a special trial of the author of Clodius’s death.
